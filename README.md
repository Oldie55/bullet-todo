An app to manage your tasks. The layout and functionality got inspired by a journal method called "Bullet Journal".

This app stores its data in the local storage at the moment. Thus, your changes will be persisted per device but can't be synced across platforms.

## PWA

This app is a Progressive Web App. Therefore you can add it as an app on a desktop or phone.

For it to work seamlessly, I recommend to use a browser based on Chromium.

On the desktop, you can add it via the plus button at the end of the url bar:

On mobile, there should appear a bar at the bottom to add it to the homescreen:
